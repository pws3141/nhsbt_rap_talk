<aside class="notes">
<p>RAPs are automated analytical processes including everything from initial data extract, data cleaning, analysis and modelling to visualisation and reporting. What’s special about a RAP is that it’s designed to ensure reproducibility, quality and efficiency.</p>
<p>RAP principals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automation:
<ul>
<li>Faster processes: Much faster to get the computer to do all the work!</li>
<li>More resource: Free up analyst time to work on other things</li>
<li>Accuracy: Reduces the risk of human error</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modular, re-usable code
<ul>
<li>Avoid repetition: For example if you need to suppress counts in multiple places in your script, you can just call the function each time - no need to copy and paste the same code in several places</li>
<li>Re-usability: Easier to re-use code in other work, speeding up the development of future projects</li>
<li>Integration: Easier to “slot in” other people’s functions - no need to reinvent the wheel if a solution already exists!</li>
<li>Faster on-boarding: Code is easier to understand, so new users can get up to speed faster</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Transparency:
<ul>
<li>Improve public trust: through transparency of our processes</li>
<li>Identify mistakes: More eyes on the code makes it more likely that mistakes will be spotted</li>
<li>Feedback: Readers of the code are able to suggest and make improvements to it</li>
<li>Collaboration: Increases collaboration and knowledge sharing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Open source
<ul>
<li>Free: open-source tools are completely free to use</li>
<li>Support: they tend to have a very active community of helpful people to seek advice and support from</li>
<li>Reusability: anyone can run open-source code, you don’t need to be a fellow user of a proprietary system. This makes it easier to share work across teams and organisations</li>
<li>Use other people’s code: Reusability goes both ways! We can take advantage of the libraries, packages, and other code made by others<br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Version Control:
<ul>
<li>Auditability: Create an audit trail of changes made, logging what changes were made when and by whom</li>
<li>Roll backs: Enable users to revert changes, or roll back to previous versions</li>
<li>Enhanced collaboration: Makes collaboration on coding projects much easier</li>
<li>Code quality: Makes it easier to peer-review code for quality and reliability</li>
<li>Transparency: Enables code to be shared more easily, using cloud services like GitHub or GitLab.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>The non-RAP way Let’s compare this to the current state of play that we are trying to move beyond with RAP. Imagine a publication process that doesn’t use the principles above. It might involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually running queries against a data store to retrieve, join, and clean the data</li>
<li>Exporting the data and manually importing it into another statistical or analysis package</li>
<li>Creating some statistics/outputs</li>
<li>Manually copying these to an Excel/Word/PDF report</li>
</ul>
<p>The gist is: a processes requiring a lot of manual steps, and usually using proprietary software.</p>
<p>This has several downsides such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time consuming: manual steps are time consuming, not only to carry out, but because they introduce a point where further manual quality assurance (QA) is needed</li>
<li>Potential for error: Fiddly manual steps introduce the possibility of human error. Lack of tests mean we can’t be completely sure how future changes affect the old code</li>
<li>Scalability: If you need to add a new table or statistic to the publication, the process will take longer to complete</li>
<li>Difficult to extend: Code written on in a non-modular way using proprietary systems is harder to extend when changes need to be made</li>
