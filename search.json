What’s special about a RAP is that it’s designed to ensure reproducibility, quality and efficiency.\nRAP principals:\n\nAutomation:\n\nFaster processes: Much faster to get the computer to do all the work!\nMore resource: Free up analyst time to work on other things\nAccuracy: Reduces the risk of human error\n\nModular, re-usable code\n\nAvoid repetition: For example if you need to suppress counts in multiple places in your script, you can just call the function each time - no need to copy and paste the same code in several places\nRe-usability: Easier to re-use code in other work, speeding up the development of future projects\nIntegration: Easier to “slot in” other people’s functions - no need to reinvent the wheel if a solution already exists!\nFaster on-boarding: Code is easier to understand, so new users can get up to speed faster\n\nTransparency:\n\nImprove public trust: through transparency of our processes\nIdentify mistakes: More eyes on the code makes it more likely that mistakes will be spotted\nFeedback: Readers of the code are able to suggest and make improvements to it\nCollaboration: Increases collaboration and knowledge sharing\n\nOpen source\n\nFree: open-source tools are completely free to use\nSupport: they tend to have a very active community of helpful people to seek advice and support from\nReusability: anyone can run open-source code, you don’t need to be a fellow user of a proprietary system. This makes it easier to share work across teams and organisations\nUse other people’s code: Reusability goes both ways! We can take advantage of the libraries, packages, and other code made by others\n\n\nVersion Control:\n\nAuditability: Create an audit trail of changes made, logging what changes were made when and by whom\nRoll backs: Enable users to revert changes, or roll back to previous versions\nEnhanced collaboration: Makes collaboration on coding projects much easier\nCode quality: Makes it easier to peer-review code for quality and reliability\nTransparency: Enables code to be shared more easily, using cloud services like GitHub or GitLab."

Imagine a publication process that doesn’t use the principles above. It might involve:\n\nManually running queries against a data store to retrieve, join, and clean the data\nExporting the data and manually importing it into another statistical or analysis package\nCreating some statistics/outputs\nManually copying these to an Excel/Word/PDF report\n\nThe gist is: a processes requiring a lot of manual steps, and usually using proprietary software.\nThis has several downsides such as:\n\nTime consuming: manual steps are time consuming, not only to carry out, but because they introduce a point where further manual quality assurance (QA) is needed\nPotential for error: Fiddly manual steps introduce the possibility of human error. Lack of tests mean we can’t be completely sure how future changes affect the old code\nScalability: If you need to add a new table or statistic to the publication, the process will take longer to complete\nDifficult to extend: Code written on in a non-modular way using proprietary systems is harder to extend when changes need to be made"
